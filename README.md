So, after how the files are going to be checked. and since, it is assumed to be run on a "new" environment, I had removed the ssh config file and the ip address of my servers. which are no more available. 
However, the said files have successfully worked when I run them in my own environment.
please contact me if anything goes wrong. 
Sincierely,
VMT
